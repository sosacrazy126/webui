# RA.Aid Enhanced Server Implementation PRD

## Overview
The Enhanced RA.Aid Server will provide a real-time, event-driven WebSocket interface that integrates with RA.Aid's existing modules. This server will support a three-phase task execution model (Research, Planning, Implementation) with proper memory integration and error handling.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Command-Line and Configuration Integration
- Create a CLI entry point that parses arguments like host, port, model, and operational flags
- Implement a configuration system with default values that can be overridden by CLI arguments
- Support environment variable configuration for API keys and other sensitive information
- Provide comprehensive help text for all CLI options

### 2. FastAPI and WebSocket Integration
- Initialize a FastAPI application with proper metadata
- Set up CORS settings to allow web client connections
- Establish WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication
- Implement client identification and connection state tracking
- Support multiple simultaneous client connections

### 3. Memory Integration
- Create a centralized memory system that persists across task phases
- Implement connection-specific state that merges with global memory
- Support data retrieval for context enrichment in each phase
- Ensure thread/client isolation for multi-user scenarios

### 4. Task Phase Management
- Implement the three-phase execution model:
  - Research: Gather context and information
  - Planning: Create an execution strategy
  - Implementation: Execute the planned changes
- Enable phase isolation with proper error handling
- Allow for research-only mode that skips planning and implementation
- Support progress tracking and status updates

### 5. Real-Time Updates
- Provide granular status updates during task execution
- Implement structured message format for client communication
- Support cancellation of in-progress tasks
- Handle WebSocket disconnection gracefully

### 6. Error Handling
- Implement error isolation for each task phase
- Provide clear error messages with context
- Support recovery from certain error conditions
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Code Structure
- Follow modular design patterns
- Implement clean separation of concerns
- Use asynchronous programming throughout
- Ensure proper type hints for all functions

### 2. Performance
- Optimize WebSocket communication
- Implement efficient memory operations
- Support concurrent client connections
- Handle long-running operations without blocking

### 3. Security
- Implement proper input validation
- Support future authentication mechanisms
- Handle sensitive information securely
- Follow security best practices for web applications

### 4. Testing
- Create unit tests for core functionality
- Implement integration tests for WebSocket communication
- Support test coverage reporting
- Provide testing utilities for development

## Future Enhancements
- Authentication middleware for secure connections
- Rate limiting for WebSocket messages
- Additional HTTP endpoints for monitoring
- Progress events during each phase
- Structured error codes for easier debugging

## Integration Points
- Existing RA.Aid agent modules
- Memory management system
- Web client interface
- Monitoring and logging systems
